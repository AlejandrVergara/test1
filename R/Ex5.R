1.Median Arrival Delay: This involves determining the central value that best represents the typical
delay experienced upon flight arrival. The median arrival delay is calculated for a specific
group of flights.

2.Proportion of Flights with Specific Delays: This analysis focuses on identifying the percentage
of flights that arrive either significantly early or late. Delays of 15 minutes, 30 minutes,
and 2 hours are considered,providing insights into the distribution of delay occurrences within
the flight group.

3.Average Departure Delay: This analysis calculates the average delay encountered before a flight's
departure. It offers insights into the typical delay experienced before takeoff.

4.Punctuality Percentage: The punctuality percentage is determined by calculating the ratio of on-time
flights (those with no arrival delay) to the total number of flights. Additionally,
this percentage is contrasted with the percentage of flights that experience significant delays
(2 hours late). This comparison highlights the disparity between punctual flights and those with
substantial delays.

5.Arrival Delay Distribution: This analysis involves creating a histogram or density
plot that visuallyVpresents the distribution of arrival delays across all flights.
By visualizing the data, common delay rangesVand outlierscan be identified,
aiding in understanding the overall delay patterns"
